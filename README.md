I Pray in front of guru granth sahib ji for "my new journey begins as a CSE student at Gndec.
  After 1hr of kirtan started Anand Sahib path starts and after that ardas will be started in which all students and teachers pray for start a new session of btech. after the hukamnan from granth sahib that is:

  <br>"jo nar dukh mai dukh nahee maanai"<br/>
 <br> "sukh sanayhu ar bhai nahee jaa kai kanchan maatee maanai. ||1|| rahaa-o"<br/>
 <br> "nah nindi-aa nah ustat jaa kai lobh moh abhimaana"<br/>
