<i><h1>My first day Experience at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College,Ludhiana</h1><i/>
<body>Hello Everyone!
  Today i am talking about my first day at guru nanak dev engineering college.That day is most memoriable for me.On that Day. a day before that day college prof. message us on Whatsapp that Every students of IT and CSE should be come in college Gurudwara sahib at 9"o clock. when i go into Gurudwara sahib i see that kirtan is starts there and students were sitting peacefully in front of Guru Granth sahib ji. I Pray in front of guru granth sahib ji for "my new journey begins as a CSE student at Gndec.
  After 1hr of kirtan started Anand Sahib path starts and after that ardas will be started in which all students and teachers pray for start a new session of btech. after the hukamnan from granth sahib that is:

  <br>"jo nar dukh mai dukh nahee maanai"<br/>
 <br> "sukh sanayhu ar bhai nahee jaa kai kanchan maatee maanai. ||1|| rahaa-o"<br/>
 <br> "nah nindi-aa nah ustat jaa kai lobh moh abhimaana"<br/>
After the Hukamnama in Gurudwara Sahib, all students went for lunch outside the Gurudwara. After that, my friend and I proceeded towards the auditorium. The time had come for us to mark our attendance. Initially, I looked at the notice board to find my name. Then, I moved to the first table to sign in where I found a teacher who handed me a file. Afterward, I entered the auditorium. The auditorium was fully furnished and air-conditioned. I took my seat with my friends. On that day, all teachers congratulated the students on their first day at college. There were many great personalities who guided us for the upcoming four years. This was the first day of the induction program which gave me a lot of knowledge.
<br>
AT THE END I ENLOY A DAY MAKE THIS MEMORIABLE!
