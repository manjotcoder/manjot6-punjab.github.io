  Hello everyone! Today, I am talking about my first day at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College. That day is most memorable for me. The day before, college professors messaged us on WhatsApp that all students of IT and CSE should come to the college Gurudwara Sahib at 9 o'clock. When I arrived at Gurudwara Sahib, kirtan had already begun and students were sitting peacefully in front of Guru Granth Sahib Ji. I prayed in front of Guru Granth Sahib Ji for the start of my new journey as a CSE student at GNDEC. After an hour of kirtan, Anand Sahib path began followed by an ardas, where all students and teachers prayed to start a new session of BTech. After the hukamnama from Guru Granth Sahib Ji,

  <br>"jo nar dukh mai dukh nahee maanai"<br/>
 <br> "sukh sanayhu ar bhai nahee jaa kai kanchan maatee maanai. ||1|| rahaa-o"<br/>
 <br> "nah nindi-aa nah ustat jaa kai lobh moh abhimaana"<br/>
After the Hukamnama in Gurudwara Sahib, all students went for lunch outside the Gurudwara. After that, my friend and I proceeded towards the auditorium. The time had come for us to mark our attendance. Initially, I looked at the notice board to find my name. Then, I moved to the first table to sign in where I found a teacher who handed me a file. Afterward, I entered the auditorium. The auditorium was fully furnished and air-conditioned. I took my seat with my friends. On that day, all teachers congratulated the students on their first day at college. There were many great personalities who guided us for the upcoming four years. This was the first day of the induction program which gave me a lot of knowledge.

AT THE END I ENLOY A DAY MAKE THIS MEMORIABLE!
